# LSP-Zuban

LSP package for the Zuban LSP.

Zuban is a high-performance Python Language Server and type checker implemented in Rust, by the author of Jedi. Zuban is 20–200× faster than Mypy, while using roughly half the memory and CPU compared to Ty and Pyrefly. It offers both a PyRight-like mode and a Mypy-compatible mode, which behaves just like Mypy; supporting the same config files, command-line flags, and error messages.
